          Every day, there are millions of individuals who interact with HTML
          on the daily. In fact, these individuals interact with HTML for long
          periods throughout the day. If you are reading this paragraph, then
          you too are interacting with HTML. But what is HTML? How is it used
          in everyday life and how is it applied? The intention of this
          document is to answer these questions, as well as provide tips for
          developers who are looking into writing HTML themselves.

            HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language", which is actually a
            standard for how documents are designed to be displayed on a
            webpage. Depending on who you're talking to, many would say that
            HTML is not an actual coding language, but just a markup language as
            the name implies. At the end of the day, HTML is the building block
            behind every webpage and web application!
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML uses elements, which essentially is node that, when put
            together, structures a webpage. Below are elements that are present
            in every standard HTML file:
          </p>
          <code class="focused-background">
            &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;: <span class="italic">The root of an HTML document</span>
            <br/>
            &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;: <span class="italic">Contains information about the webpage</span>
            <br/>
            &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;: <span class="italic">Contains the contents of the webpage</span>

            In order to develop a webpage, one must abide by the standards of
            HTML. HTML is the leading langauge used to structure both webpages
            and web-based applications, so you must know HTML if you want to
            write even the simplest of web documents!
          </p>
          <p>Below are a couple of uses for HTML:</p>
          <ul class="focused-background">
            <li>
              To become a frontend developer, you <strong>must</strong> know
              HTML.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you want to display even a basic document on a web browser, you
              must know HTML!
            </li>
            <li>
              Understanding HTML provides you a better understanding of the IOT
              (Internet of Things).

            <h3>Good practices in HTML</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            There are a lot of things to keep in mind when writing HTML. It's
            easy to get started and just throwing a bunch of elements together,
            but there's much more to a webpage than what a user sees. The
            underlying HTML must be written in a clean manner where fellow
            developers can follow behind you and understand the content flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the right practices and developing good habits is key to
            developing good HTML. But exactly is "good HTML"?
          </p>
          <ol class="focused-background">
            <li>Good HTML does not overuse the &lt;div&gt; element.</li>
            <li>
              Good HTML uses semantic tags, like &lt;main&gt; and
              &lt;section&gt; elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Good HTML includes the proper &lt;meta&gt; tags contained in the
              &lt;head&gt; element.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The above rules are just a few out of many that every front-end
            developer should follow at a basic level. More specifically, the
            rules above will allow your webpage to become more accessible to
            users with disabilities, as well as increase the webpage's SEO
            (Search Engine Optimization).
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that we explored the HTML basics, the next logical step to take
            is to style our webpage. But how is that done?

            <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            To style modern day webpages, a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file
            is made and linked to the applicable index file. In fact, just
            about every single webpage you view is styled thanks to CSS.
            But what is CSS exactly?
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is a language used to do a number of things. For starters,
            elements are selected in the CSS language so that the developer
            may apply visual styles to said elements. Not only that, but CSS
            also can determine how a webpage or application looks on screen,
            paper (when a page is printed), or on other medias. Below is an
            example of how CSS looks:
          </p>
          <code class="focused-background">
            body { background-color: black; color: white; }
            <br/>
            header { font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem; }
          </code>
          <p>
            The above CSS code is creating a rule to make the &lt;body&gt; element of the HTML
            document a black background with white text, while making changing
            the font size of elements inside of &lt;header&gt; elements. The question is, how
            is the browser knowing which elements are being selected to apply a
            styling rule?

            <h3>Selectors in CSS</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            In CSS, a selector is used to target specific elements
            for styling. There are many types of selectors, which can be referenced
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>
            on the w3schools website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below are a couple of common CSS selectors being applied:
          </p>
          <code class="focused-background">
            The "type" selector:
            <br/>
            div { width: 80%; margin: auto; }
            <br/>
            p { font-size: 1.15rem; color: red; }
          </code>
          <p>
            <strong>Type</strong> selectors are used to target a general element for high-level styling.
            These can be used to easily provide typography stylings to all of the
            &lt;p&gt; elements, or give all of the &lt;div&gt; elements a width and margins.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the above example, the element types are <span class="italic">p</span>
            and <span class="italic">div</span> elements.
          </p>
          <code class="focused-background">
            The "class" selector:
            <br/>
            .container { width: 100%; min-height: 200px; }
          </code>
          <p>
            <strong>Class</strong> selectors are used to target a collected group of elements
            that share the selected class attribute's value. To target a class attribute, a period (.)
            is placed before the name of the class.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the above example, the class attribute value is "container".
          </p>
          <code class="focused-background">
            The "id" selector:
            <br/>
            #login-form { padding: 30px; min-height: 450px; }
          </code>
          <p>
            <strong>Id</strong> selectors are used to target a single element with the specified id
            attribute's value. These are meant to target only one element, as it is recommended to only
            use one id value in an entire HTML document.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the above example, the id attribute value is "login-form".

          <p>
            Understanding proper CSS and the rules of CSS is <strong>crucial</strong>
            to becoming a strong frontend developer. Every webpage has to be styled for it
            to appeal to users. Otherwise, your application may not be used often, and
            you may not be taken seriously as a developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            That being said, mastering CSS is just like mastering any other language;
            it takes a lot of time and practice to understand CSS works. Styling a webpage
            is arguably one of the most difficult parts of frontend development, and can be
            frustrating at times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are a couple of good practices to reduce the frustration when styling
            webpages:
          </p>
          <ul class="focused-background">
            <li>
              Use class selectors often. This will help outline your HTML,
              as well as target groups of elements for easier mass style changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not over-complicate CSS selectors. Selectors can go into depth,
              which will cause you and fellow developers headache if styles need to change.
            </li>
            <li>
              Write comments in your CSS file. Comments look like <strong>/* content */</strong>,
              which can provide you and fellow developers helpful notes in massive CSS
              files. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Always keep <strong>specificity</strong> in mind. This is a very important
              concept. You can reference specificity
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.
